# SNAKE

### DESCRIPTION 
This is a very simple game built using HTML, CSS and Javascript

### Motive
I built this project because I used to play this alot as a kid. It's very simple and a nice way to kill some time. As well I wanted to build something simple to sharpen and freshen up my Javascript skills

### Skills
During the development of this project I utilized CSS grid to create the game board, the snake and food. I used Javascript modules to export and import various functions from different files in order to keep code neat, organized and understandable. I learned that you can put a script tag linked to a js file in the head of HTML while using 'defer' to make sure the javascript files are loaded after the HTML renders. 

### Credits
